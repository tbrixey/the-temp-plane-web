## Getting Started

Just a next.js app I made when I was working on a game thing. I've since given it up realizing I just don't have time to take it where I want it to be.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### API

The api is seperate here and the api in this app just has basic auth.
